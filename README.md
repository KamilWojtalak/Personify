# Personify

Personify is an app for building and managing detailed personal profiles-capture notes.

Such as:
- interaction history  
- repetitive topics  
- social links  

You can create multiple ideal personas as templates and real people, then assign each person to one or more personas. Personify aggregates information about everyone you meet and lets you quickly scan who you should reach out to next.

I built this because I had trouble making new connections in my 20s, and here I have topics ready to discuss interesting subjects I learned from others, ensuring conversations are highly personalized. 

Additionally, if someone is looking for someone I can recommend, it will be easy to find them thanks to the information I've saved.

Does it make sense? I don't know. I'm trying my best :D
